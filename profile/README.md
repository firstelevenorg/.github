## Our Founder's Letter

As the founder of FirstEleven, I believe technology has the potential to improve the world. It is our responsibility as humans to guarantee that technology is used for the greater benefit and in accordance with human nature.

Technology will not develop on its own; we must constantly improve and innovate. We must be responsible and ethical when it comes to the usage of technology, and we must seek to build a self-sustaining infrastructure.

By leveraging technology, we have the ability to automate repetitive processes, freeing up time and energy for more creative and demanding endeavors. This allows us to fully enjoy our planet's bounty, travel to new regions, and explore the universe's mysteries. We must continue to develop novel technologies to explore the Earth's depths and expand our horizons for discovery.

Our ultimate goal is to become a multi-planetary species, which will need considerable technical improvements. However, we must consider our environmental impact and ensure that our research and invention are sustainable and do not harm the ecosystem.
FirstEleven aims to integrate technology seamlessly into our daily lives, allowing us to focus on what matters most. We envision a better society where everyone has the necessary tools to excel in their chosen profession or career. Founded on the principles of collaboration, innovation, and growth. By using technology for good, we can positively impact humanity and build a better future for future generations. - (Liyolo Metsing Moko) Leo Moko

## What is more crucial?

Recognizing wisdom and talent globally, it is imperative to confront behaviors that threaten future generations. It is critical to actively shape our future and embrace a simpler way of life. Learning from the mistakes of previous generations is key to keeping them from impacting our world and people. Urgent effort is required to ensure that our children do not experience the same obstacles in their personal and professional lives. Breaking this pattern of behavior is crucial to creating a better future for ourselves and future generations. Let us work together to be the positive change that the world needs. - (Liyolo Metsing Moko) Leo Moko
